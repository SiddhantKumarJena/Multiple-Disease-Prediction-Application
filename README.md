# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Application
A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit to predict the likelihood of diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s. The app leverages machine learning models to provide real-time risk assessments based on user-submitted health data.

Features
Multi-Disease Prediction: Supports predictions for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s, offering tailored feedback for each condition.
Machine Learning Models: Trained on historical health datasets to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.
Interactive UI: Intuitive interface with a sidebar for seamless navigation between different disease prediction pages.
Real-Time Predictions: Utilizes pre-trained models stored with Pickle for immediate results based on user inputs.
Risk Assessment Feedback: Provides users with detailed insights into potential disease risks, enabling informed health decisions.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks: Streamlit
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pickle
Deployment: Lightweight and easily deployable Streamlit app

How It Works
Data Input: Users submit health parameters (e.g., age, glucose level, blood pressure) via a web form.
Prediction: Pre-trained machine learning models process the data and output the disease risk.
Navigation: A sidebar enables quick switching between prediction pages for different diseases.

Future Enhancements
Expand to include additional diseases and health conditions.
Incorporate advanced visualizations for better user understanding.
Implement cloud-based deployment for scalability and accessibility.
